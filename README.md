# E-commerce-Product-Page
* This code creates a simple and responsive e-commerce product page layout, displaying a product with its image, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. It also includes a related products section, header, navigation, and footer. Here’s a breakdown of each section and how they work:

# HTML Structure
1. Header:
- Contains the store’s title and tagline.
2. Navigation:
- Displays links for navigation to other sections like Home, Shop, Categories, and Contact.
3. Product Section:
- Product Images: Shows the main product image.
- Product Information: Displays the product name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
4. Related Products:
- A section that displays similar products using the product-card class. Each product card includes an image, name, and price.
5. Footer:
- Basic footer with copyright information.
# CSS Styling
1. General Styling:
- Sets a default font, colors, padding, and background color for the body.
2. Header and Navigation:
-Header and nav background colors (#333 and #444) and white text color.
- Nav links have hover effects for better user experience.
3. Product Section:
- Uses flex to arrange product images and information side by side.
- Responsive design with @media to stack elements vertically on smaller screens.
- Price styled with a highlighted color (#e8491d) and larger font.
4. Related Products Section:
- Products displayed in a grid with individual product-card styles for spacing and shadow effects.
- Flex layout ensures that they wrap to fit various screen sizes.
5. Footer:
- Footer styling matches the header and provides consistent branding across the page.

# How It Works
* Flexbox Layouts: The page uses flex properties to create flexible, responsive layouts that adapt to screen size changes.
* CSS Box Shadow: Adds shadow effects around elements like product cards, giving them a card-like appearance.
* Media Query: Ensures that on screens smaller than 768px, the product section elements stack vertically to fit the screen better.
* Button Styling: Adds basic styling to the "Add to Cart" button for user interaction and matches the page color theme.

--> This structure makes it easy for users to view product details and related products, creating a clean and user-friendly shopping experience.
